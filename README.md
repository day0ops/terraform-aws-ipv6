# Terraform AWS IPv6

Terraform project for provisioning IPv6 clusters in AWS.
It follows the architecture below to provision the clusters in a hub-spoke topology.

## Instructions

Variables can be provided via `terraform.tfvars`. Refer to the example below,

```
owner = "joe.blogg"

aws_profile = "default"
region      = "ap-southeast-1"

max_availability_zones_per_cluster = 2
kubernetes_version                 = "1.24"
```

`terraform output` will show how to inject the kubeconfig configuration.

### Bastion Host

A bastion host can be provisioned by setting `enable_bastion = true` in `master.tf` in each individual VPC.
When this is enabled make sure to also set `ec2_ssh_key` to the key pair set in the AWS console. Typically this will give you a public key to load on your machine whichh you can copy to `~/.ssh/public_key.pem`. You may need to set the permissions to `400` for this pem file.
This will enable SSH access in bastion host and enable jumpto the nodes in the private subnet.

Locally SSH configuration can be set to jump to the node via bastion host. For e.g.

```
Host bastion-host
  HostName <bastion host public ip>
  User ec2-user
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/public_key.pem
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host private-node
  HostName <node in private subnet>
  User ec2-user
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/public_key.pem
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  ProxyJump bastion-host
```

followed by the command,

```
ssh private-node
```
